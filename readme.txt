== Pluggables ==

Contents of `/pluggables/` extend the functionality of WordPress, they're each technically plugins that could be fully developed one day. Until then, they're standalone and portable from theme-to-theme.

=== Pseudo Post Formats ===

Instead of assigning a post format, this theme looks at the content and determins the post format:

| Post Format | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| IMAGE | title and featured image, no content |
| STATUS | no title |
| (Default Post) | title, feature image, content, optional excerpt |

When no title is present, this theme will create a title of YYYYMMDD.

See [`/pluggable/auto-post-format.php`](pluggable/auto-post-format.php) for more info.
