* `grunt readme` converts WordPress.org readme.txt to .md for Github
* `grunt watch` will watch for file changes in aforementioned files and do tasks automatically during dev

## Pluggables ##

Contents of `/pluggables/` extend the functionality of WordPress, they're each technically plugins that could be fully developed one day. Until then, they're standalone and portable from theme-to-theme.

## Pseudo Post Formats ##

This theme does not use `post_formats` in the traditional sense. I found the added step of changing post formats easy-to-forget while creating content, and that my post formats were less about that flag and more about what type of content is in the post. There two conditions in which a `post` can have that will rendered in a slightly different post format. When a post has:

- **No Title** it assumes a "Status" pseudo post format. This makes it so the `<h1>` does not render, and the `wp_title` and `the_title` are filtered with the date.
- **No Content and a Featured Image** assumes a "Image" pseudo Post Format, these posts also do not have a title display on the site (as to not take away from the image, but it still does appear in `wp_title()`), and no content will display.

This is done to reduce steps while generating content, to minimize `if` statements throughout the template files, and to streamline the logic of the `partials/` folder.

The following helper functions are available:
* `dsca_get_pseduo_post_format()`
* `dsca_is_pseduo_post_format_image()`
* `dsca_is_pseduo_post_format_status()`

See [`/pluggable/pseduo-post-format.php`](pluggable/pseduo-post-format.php) for more info.
